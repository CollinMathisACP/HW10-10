<h1>Time Series</h1>
<h2>Fundamental Difference</h2>
<p>
Chapter 7 deals with distributions. In this form of data, there are multiple data points of a single variable, each with their own value. The meaning of this data is found primarily in the frequency of each value, along with other factors that are consequences of that primary focus. In chapter 8, the data in question comes in the form of a time series. This is a single continuous variable that changes over a period of time. The fundamental difference between these two data types is the former finds meaning in frequency, and the latter in progression over time.

<h2>Time Series Line Charts</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Presents a clear visualization of the variable</li>
<li>Larger trends in the data are easy to identify</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Factors such as seasonality and noise can muddle the data without it being obvious</li>
<li>Can require substantial transformation to identify more subtle trends</li>
</ul>
    
<h2>Logarithmic Scales</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can reveal a trend in exponential data</li>
<li>Results in a scale that is easier to make sense of</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Is highly situational, requires exponential data</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>Horizon Charts</h2>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elegant, can give an overview of many related variables at once</li>
<li>Visually appealing, even to someone with minimal understanding of statistics</li>
</ul>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be hard to focus in on a single instance</li>
</ul>
